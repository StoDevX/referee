# Referee

> What is this?

Referee is the new fancy project being planned and started soon that will steal some of the functionality of [cs251-toolkit] and bridge it into the new age of web-ness.

We still intend on using most of cs251-toolkit's style for grading homework in a nice, contained way, but we are going to consider some structural changes to make this more condusive to expansion to cover more use-cases.
Part of this will involve expanding and rewriting this as a web service, complete with storage and management of users, groups, authentication, assignments, events, and other bells and whistles that are yet to be planned.
